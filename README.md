## Overview of the Project
    
### Project: Password Strength Checker (PSC) 

### Objective
The project aims to create a Password Strength Checker that evaluates passwords based on length, complexity, and uniqueness, providing real-time feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

### Key activities
- **Research**: Define password strength criteria (length, complexity).
- **Design UI**: Create a simple, user-friendly interface with a password input, strength bar, and feedback.
- **Develop Algorithm**: Implement the algorithm to assess password strength based on key factors.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Enable dynamic feedback as the user types.

### Technologies used
**HTML**: For structuring the web page and form elements.
**CSS**: For styling the user interface and designing the password strength meter.
**Web Browsers**: For testing and running the tool on various platforms.
**Version Control** (Git): For tracking development and collaboration.

### Key Insights
**Password Complexity**: Strong passwords need a mix of characters and sufficient length.
**Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate guidance helps users improve password strength.
**Visual Indicators**: Strength bars make password security easy to understand.
